## Project Overview

I made this Command Line Application (CLI) for the purpose of saving the time of writing README.md files and stop the worry of markdown typos. I also created this application to test my experience with Javascript, NodeJS, and Node Package Manager.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- NPM

## Features

- A fucntional table of contents for easy navigation of the README.md file.
- With this application a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the users project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, License, and Questions
- When the user selects a license, a badge is added near the top of the README.md file and the proper documentation is added to the "License" section.
- The user is prompted for their GitHub username and E-Mail address for the "Contact and Questions" section.
